Some notes about the software and the things I'm trying to do.

The idea of the program is to be an easy way to create a database, and an associated api.

The way I have decided to do this is to write two(?) jsons.
One will define the database schema
The other will define the api endpoints.

Setting up and using the software will hopefully look something like:

```
npm install

create .env file

npm run build

create database schema jsons
create api jsons

npm start
```
At this point you should be able to use the described api's to access the database.

! After some expirementing I'm not sure how to make knex.js create the tables from a json. 
  I will look a little more, and also look at how querying objects that wern't created with knex looks.

Some things I am thinking about now:
? should each desired api/database thing have only one json file that has the api and db info ?
? does there need to be two different api's, one for admin tasks, and for write tasks, and one for read ?
